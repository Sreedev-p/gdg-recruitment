<-------------------------------------------------- Part 2 / 3 -------------------------------------------------->

Welcome to Challenge Two — the middle layer between you and the final flag.

This time, you’ve been handed a single file: heheheha.png.

At first glance it’s just an image ; But in a CTF, appearances are almost always deceptive.

Find the second fragment. You’ll need it.

This is why we clash >:3  
Good luck.
